## Introduction
Crime around school neighborhoods has been proven time and time again to hinder the academic performance of students and provide obstacles to success. Understanding how crime increases in neighborhoods for economic reasons, mainly for business and population dense areas can show higher crime rates (Owens, 2016; Twinman, 2017). Stress about crime in neighborhoods not only for students but for their families is also a problem as considerable mental helth issues have been proven to show up (Dustmann et al., 2014). Significant impact on performance, attendance, and long term negative effects have also been proven in cases of extreme crime and violence in school neighborhood areas (Michaelson et al., 2019). But schools have shown to try to deter these effects by implementing volunteer policing program and other community led projects to help stop crime (McMillen, 2019). 

In social network analysis, there has been a lot of research done on criminal networks mainly using bipartite,social networks, social structure, and exponential random graph models (Melamed, 2014; Wang et al., 2011; Alzahrani, 2014). While reviewing the role of neighborhood networks, Faust and Tita suggest looking at the ties in the network are assumed to be doing their roles, and to understand potential weaknessness in the data as well as in potential analysis ( Faust, Tita, 2014).

For this paper a dataset with full location attributes for reported police crimes in Mexico City including longitudal and latitudal elements, time of day, month, and year, street, neighborhood, and ward where the crime took place are available online at data.gob.mx, as well as a dataset with basic school location and school level atrributes found on INEGI. These two datasets were merged and implemented in Geographical Information System (GIS) software to create a buffer of a 150-meter radius around the collected schools and the crime data within those buffers was collected to create the dataset being used for network analysis. Analysis on the relations of crime to schools could be beneficial for implementing effective programs that help deter future crime around school neighborhoods. For this reason, we how to answer is how do crimes cluster around specific schools and which crimes happen in conjunction with each other? Looking at the data in a spatialized geographic version is helpful to understand which school attract the most crime, or "hot spots", but it will be beneficial to the connections between schools and the crimes that surround them.

## Methods
An example of analyzing geographic space and network space in the same context is provided by Radlil et al. where they use relative location and structural position to connect territorial gang rivalries (Radil et al., 2010). The structural embeddedness and positionality of the geography and the network allow the researchers to get a better understanding of gang violence spread across gang territories based on an actor's position in the network, their relationships, and the spatial settings provided by the observed space. In their case, the territory they study is almost isolated by highways, rivers, and industrial zones in East Los Angeles. Because of a history of area violence stemming from various socio demographic factors, this areas was ripe with gang violence at the time of the study (Radil et al., 2010). To understand embeddedness, they applied a specific methodology where they 1) reviewed the geographic area boundaries, 2) got frequencies of violent crimes per census block, 3) created a rivalry matrix to show which violent crimes are done from different gangs, 4) multiplied both geographic areas and rivalry matrix together from two separate matrix blocks, 5) They then spatialized the social networks by finding subsets, and used CONCOR to find equivalent geographies, 6) A dendrogram and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were used along with GIS mapping to review the results (Radil et al., 2010). 

For the crime to school dataset, all crimes are located around a school's 150m radius, and understanding which are more prevalent, or which might happen in conjunction are important explorations. In this case, understanding centrality measures, duality, and bi-dynamic line graphs will help understand the overall clustering of crimes, the between and within crime and school group relations, and the ties between crime and schools. This is done by creating matrix structures of the crime and school labels, converting it into network form, and keeping separate versions. 


## Creating the Network

Creating a network for analysis actualizes connections between nodes and edges. These entities are used to create network objects that represent adjacency matrices, or semimatrices, which are square matrices with nodes as the network's rows and columns and the binary connections (0, 1) as their edges (Luke, 2015). At its simplest connection, for example, a link between two nodes is represented by a 1, 0 otherwise. Sometimes networks can be directed where a node sends information to a receiving node, but the information is not reciprocated. In our case, our data is undirected and represents two groups, crimes and schools. The crime group is comprised of each unique crime reported to the police, and the school groups shows categories for school levels i.e. preschool, public middle school, private elementary, etc. The network has 474 ties, 163 nodes, and a density of 0.036. Density can be explained as the proportion of ties found to the maximum number of possible ties (Luke, 2015). As the density is low, it shows that the network is not very interconnected, meaning nodes might not be tied to one another very often, you can see this in Figure 1 where all the outside nodes have just one connection to the inner network space.

## Centrality Measures

Looking at the centrality measures of a network helps to identify various ways in which a node is connected to other nodes. There are 3 basic types of centrality measures including degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality. Degree centrality measures the number of connections a node is to other nodes within the network (Wasserman, Faust, 1994). Closeness centrality meausures how close a node is to all the other nodes in the network based on their distance apart, or how long it takes to get from one node to another. Betweenness centrality measures how many nodes a particular node sits between, for example, how central is this node for facilitating information flow within a network, are they an essential stop or can they be skipped?

The degree centrality for the top three school nodes is, PRIMARIA GENERAL (d = 198) translates to "public elementary school", PREESCOLAR GENERAL(d = 160) translantes to "public preschool", and SECUNDARIA GENERAL (d = 116) translates to "public middle school". The degree centrality for the top crime nodes is VIOLENCIA FAMILIAR (d = 30) translates to "domestic violence", ROBO A TRANSEUNTE EN VIA PUBLICA CON VIOLENCIA (d = 28) translates to "mugging", ROBO A NEGOCIO SIN VIOLENCIA (d = 24) translates to "non-violent business robbery", and AMENAZAS (d = 24) translates to "threats." With this information we can assume that public schools have a higher number of crimes in their neighborhood, and the top crimes in a school's a 150m radius are domestic "violence", "mugging", "non-violent business robbery", and "threats." Overall, the top ten nodes with the highest degree measures were schools, which is inline with the type of data we are using as schools in the center of their own 150m radius. 
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

require(sna)

# summary(crime_net)
# crime_net$val

print("Degree Centrality: Crimes")
d.cent <- degree(crime_net) #[1:126, 1:126])
# d.cent
# table(d.cent)
names(d.cent) <- crime_net %v% "vertex.names"
sort.d <- sort(d.cent)
kable(sort.d[149:163])
# top.d <- names(sort(d.cent))[157:163]
# Draw the graph with node sizes proportional to betweenness centralitiy scores:
gplot(crime_net, vertex.col = my.colors, usearrows=TRUE, vertex.cex = .05 * d.cent) + #label=names(d.cent), #label=names(d.cent),
title(main = "Degree Centrality:Crime Network")

```

The closeness centrality measures for the top three school nodes are "public elementary school", (c = 0.64), "public preschool" (c = 0.55), and "public middle school"(c = 0.47). The top crime centrality measure are "domestic violence" (c = 0.50), "mugging" (c = 0.49), "business robbery" (c = .048), and "threats" (c = 0.48). The top school and crime centralities are the same, but their order of greater closeness starts with "public elementary school", "public preschool", "domestic violence", and then "mugging". We can assume that these top nodes happen in close proximity to each other.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

require(sna)



print("Closeness Centrality: Crimes")
c.cent <- closeness(crime_net, gmode = "digraph")
# c.cent
names(c.cent) <- crime_net %v% "vertex.names"
# sort(c.cent)
sort.c <- sort(c.cent)
kable(sort.c[153:163])
top.c <- names(sort(c.cent))#[155:163]
# note there are all 0s for closeness centrality
# Draw the graph with node sizes proportional to closeness centralitiy scores:
gplot(crime_net,  vertex.col = my.colors, usearrows=TRUE, vertex.cex = 5 * c.cent) + # label=names(c.cent),
title(main = "Closeness Centrality:Crime Network")

```

The top betweenness centrality measures for school nodes are also "public elementary school" (b = 11055.1143),"public preschool" (b = 6530.8892), and "public middle school" (b = 3473.3928). The top betweenness scores for crime slightly changed and their measures are, "domestic violence" (b = 1406.7534), "mugging" (b = 977.0407), and ROBO DE VEHICULO DE SERVICIO PARTICULAR SIN VIOLENCIA (b = 889.8290) translates to "non-violent theft of a private vehicle". The top 5 betweeness nodes overall are schools, meaning that schools are a central componenet for crimes in the neighborhood. This is expected because of the nature of the data and how the radius around the schools was set-up to collect the crime data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

require(sna)

# summary(crime_net)

print("Betweeness Centrality: Crimes")
b.cent <- betweenness(crime_net, gmode = "digraph")
# table(b.cent)
names(b.cent) <- crime_net %v% "vertex.names"
sort.b <- sort(b.cent)
kable(sort.b[153:163])
# top.b <- names(sort(b.cent))[155:163]
# Draw the graph with node sizes proportional to closeness centralitiy scores:
gplot(crime_net, vertex.col = my.colors, usearrows=TRUE, vertex.cex = .05 * b.cent) + #  label=names(b.cent),
title(sub = "Betweenness Centrality:crime Network")

```


## Duality and Bi-dynamic Line Graphs

The network is composed of two sets, crime and schools, where crime can belong to a group of crimes but also to the buffer raduis around a school, and visa vera. Understanding the value of connections within and between particular sets can help understand how a particular school might be connected to a particular crime. Breiger's duality measures consider the value of ties between a set of individuals and a set of groups (Breiger, 1974). In this case crime can be understood as individuals and schools as groups (side note, an interesting turn of events would be to look at overall crime categories to individual schools and see the difference between these networks). Similar to the set-up of the dataset, Breiger's axioms help describe the ties between crime and schools, specifically the second axiom of symmetry where two connecting nodes in a membership groups are both connected to each other, instead of one directed connection. Similarly, if two membership groups share a person they are mutually related (Breiger, 1974). In his first axiom Breiger also states, "an axiom that the intersection of any two sets belonging to either class [crime, schools] is contained in the power set of the other class" (Breiger, 1974). Essentially, these two statesments describe how crime nodes and school nodes can be related by similar connecting ties, and the destinction of reflexivity where belonging to a group is relatable and groups relate to their individual members. But what does this mean for crime and schools? 

As crimes connected within a school radius we can look further into the notion of duality by using a bipartite netowrk to consider the intersection of these two sets. In thier work on temporal dynamics of bipartite networks, Broccatelli et al use bipartite networks with a temporal aspect to modes covert networks to intersect actors and events across time (Broccatelli, et al., 2016). They implement three steps, an affiliation matrix of the two sets, they generate a line graph projection where edges between individuals are transformed to nodes while excluding redundant ties, and last they further reduce the ties to contain only the edges that connect the individual nodes to the group nodes (Broccatelli, et al., 2016). 

School to school ties within crime sets show how some schools are more prone to specific crimes. These are reciprocal ties that connect the two node types that interact with each other. In Figure# there are seven main school to school clusters with the crime set while eight other sets are connected outside of the typical crime space. In Figure# crime to crime ties within schools show a different behavior than their school-to-school counterpart where most crimes do not affiliate with each other showing distant parts, and little if any connections to other dissimilar crimes. This is an interesting outcome because it shows how crime around schools is somewhat independent of itself, instead of being connected to other crimes. The comparison of school to schools within crimes is also interesting because it shows how schools are connected based on the crimes being made within their radius. 

One limitation to reviewing the crime to school data with bi-dynamic networks is its implication of time, specifically how an individual cannot perform an more than one action simultaneously and so drops factors of redundancy (Broccatelli, et al., 2016). In the case of the crime and school data, two crimes can and potentially do happen simultaneously, but the bipartite analysis works with the data because the redundancy lies in the frequency of a crime happening and redundancy can be dropped if every unique crime and every unique school is included.
